				<h1>Hi, Basecamp!</h1>
				<h2>My name is Sarah. I like exploring new places, learning new things, and making beautiful, usable websites.</h2>
				<h3>I think we should work together. Here&rsquo;s why.</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="group" id="why">
		
			<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-pencil"></i>My pen is mightier than my sword.</h4>
					<p>I always wanted to be a writer when I grew up. Before I switched to design, I studied literary arts and journalism. (If you need a glosa written, I'm your girl.) These days, I help my clients with copyediting and maintain <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog">a rather verbose blog</a>. I believe that words and design are intricately linked: neither is effective alone. <strong>Great design cannot exist without sharp, well-written copy.</strong> Good grammar means a lot to me. You'll never catch me designing a page that encourages users to "signup for this service."</p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-cutlery"></i>I eat (your own) dog food.</h4>
					<p>I've been using Basecamp every day for the past five years. It's a vital part of my daily routine. With 37Signals' focus shifting to  all-Basecamp, all the time, you're going to want someone on board who's intimately familiar with the product. That's me. <strong>I love Basecamp, and I want to help make it better.</strong> (I'd love it if Basecamp had the ability to request a follow-up on an item.) I'd love to work on a product I use every single day.</p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-rocket"></i>Office not required.</h4>
					<p>From Colombia, to Croatia, to Cambodia: I've worked <em>everywhere</em>. For the last few years, I've travelled extensively, all while maintaining a profitable, thriving freelance business. As a result, I have great time management skills, I communicate effectively, and I have no problems keeping myself motivated. I've had Skype meetings at midnight and at 7am. I've coordinated with team members from all over the globe. <strong>I make things happen.</strong> I don't believe that cubicles foster creativity, and they certainly don't make for healthy work environments.</p>
		
			</div>
			
				<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-heart"></i>Made with love.</h4>
					<p>I care about doing good work. I care about my clients. I care about the people who use the things I make. Caring means you invest your mental energies into making something great. I like being able to afford Louboutins and Cristal, but ultimately, that's not what motivates me. <strong>I want to make beautiful, usable things that people love.</strong> Basecamp has hundreds of thousands of passionate, opinionated users who care a great deal, I'm one of them. I want to help make it even better.</p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-beaker"></i>I believe in transparency.</h4>
					<p>This is why you can find me on my business' blog, talking about <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/getting-naked/">nude modelling</a> or <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/my-night-in-a-thai-jail-and-other-sordid-tales-of-despair/">run-ins with the Thai police</a>. I believe that businesses should be responsible to their customers, and I've applied this to my own business. Basecamp's policy of transparency makes me happy. And your world-class customer support is something I'd like to get behind.</p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-tint"></i>Oh, and I'm a pretty good designer, too.</h4>
					<p>There's no way my business would be celebrating its eighth birthday and sending me on round-the-world trips if I weren't. I'm great with HTML and CSS, and I've got a pretty solid familiarity with Rails and Javascript. I've done some work on iOS and web apps. I pick up new skills quickly, and I'm always trying to learn new things and better my process.</p>
					<p>This is the primary reason why I want to work at Basecamp. I love running my business, and the decision to transition away from it isn't one I take lightly. I am looking for work that will fullfil and challenge me. I want to work with passionate people who challenge me to grow as a designer. I believe Basecamp is this company.</p>
					<p><strong>Let's make great things together.</strong></p>
