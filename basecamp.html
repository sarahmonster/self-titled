				<h1>Hi, Basecamp!</h1>
				<h2>My name is Sarah. I like exploring new places, learning new things, and making beautiful, usable websites.</h2>
				<h3>I think we should work together. Here&rsquo;s why.</h3>
			</div>

		<div class="group" id="why">
		
			<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-pencil"></i>My pen is mightier than my sword.</h4>
					<p>I always wanted to be a writer when I grew up. These days, I help my clients with copyediting and maintain <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog">a rather verbose blog</a>. I believe that words and design are intricately linked: neither is effective alone. <strong>Great design cannot exist without sharp, well-written copy.</strong></p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-cutlery"></i>I eat (your own) dog food.</h4>
					<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Basecamp every day for the past five years. It&rsquo;s a vital part of my daily routine. With 37Signals&rsquo; focus shifting to  &ldquo;all Basecamp, all the time,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re going to want someone on board who&rsquo;s intimately familiar with the product. That&rsquo;s me. <strong>I love Basecamp, and I want to help make it better.</strong></p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-rocket"></i>Office <strong>definitely</strong> not required.</h4>
					<p>From Colombia, to Croatia, to Cambodia: I&rsquo;ve worked <em>everywhere</em>. I&rsquo;ve spent the last few years travelling the world, all while maintaining a profitable, thriving freelance business. As a result, I have great time management skills, I communicate effectively, and I have no problems staying motivated. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where I am: <strong>I get things done.</strong></p>
		
			</div>
			
				<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-heart"></i>Made with love.</h4>
					<p>I care about doing good work. I care about my clients. I care about the people who use the things I make. Caring means you invest your mental energies into making something great. It means you have strong opinions about small details. Louboutins and Dom Perignon are great, but ultimately, they&rsquo;re not what motivate me. <strong>I want to make great things that people love.</strong> Basecamp has hundreds of thousands of passionate, opinionated users who care a great deal, and I&rsquo;m one of them.</p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-beaker"></i>I believe in transparency.</h4>
					<p>This is why you can find me on my business&rsquo; blog, talking about <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/getting-naked/">nude modelling</a> or <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com/blog/my-night-in-a-thai-jail-and-other-sordid-tales-of-despair/">run-ins with the Thai police</a>. I believe that businesses should be responsible to their customers, and I&rsquo;ve applied this to my own business. Being open and forthright has fostered enduring, trusting relationships with <a href="http://triggersandsaprks.com/clients">clients who love me</a>. <strong>Basecamp&rsquo;s policy of transparency makes me happy.</strong> Your world-class customer support and policy of openness is something I&rsquo;d like to get behind.</p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-tint"></i>I&rsquo;m a pretty good designer, too.</h4>
					<p>There&rsquo;s no way my business would be celebrating its eighth birthday and sending me on round-the-world trips if I weren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m great with HTML and CSS, and I&rsquo;ve got a pretty solid familiarity with Rails and Javascript. I&rsquo;ve done some work on iOS and web apps and have a good understanding of how to adapt designs to different devices. I pick up new skills quickly, and I&rsquo;m always trying to better my process.</p>
					<p><strong>This is why I want to work at Basecamp.</strong> I love running my business, and the decision to transition away from it isn&rsquo;t one I take lightly. I am looking for work that will fulfill and challenge me. I want to work with passionate people who challenge me to grow as a designer. I believe Basecamp is this company.</p>
					<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s make great things together.</strong></p>
