				<h1>Hi Basecamp!</h1>
				<h2>My name is Sarah. I&rsquo;m a graphic designer, web developer, and sometimes a pirate.</h2>
				<h3>I think we should work together.<br>Here&rsquo;s why.</h3>
			</div>

		<div class="group" id="why">
		
			<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-keyboard"></i>I like to write.</h4>
					<p>I always wanted to be a writer when I grew up. I went to journalism school, briefly, and I studied literary arts in high school. (If you need a glosa written, I'm your girl.) These days, I focus instead on writing my rather verbose blog. I'm a big believer that words and design are intricately linked&mdash;neither can work alone. I'm also very invested in proper grammar, so you'll never catch me designing a page that encourages users to "signup for this service."</p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-key"></i>I eat your dog food.</h4>
					<p>I've been using Basecamp since '09, and it's a vital part of my daily routine. Since you're shifting 37Signals' focus to be solely about Basecamp, you're going to want someone on board who's intimately familiar with the product. That's me. I love Basecamp, but I'm not afraid to suggest ways it could be better. (For instance, I'd love it if Basecamp had an option to request a particular person follow up to a comment, then have that appear in their "Me" section. On larger teams where more than one person is responsible for driving a single task forward at a different time, this would be a huge help in making sure people remain accountable, as well as helping me quickly see what my actual to-do items are.) I'd love to work on a product I use every single day.</p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-rocket"></i>I&rsquo;m great at remote.</h4>
					<p>I've worked <em>everywhere</em>, from Colombia to Cambodia. I've spent the last few years of my business travelling the world extensively, and I've become really, really good at communicating. I've had Skype meetings at midnight and at 7am. I've coordinated with team members from all over the globe. I don't believe that cubicles make for great work environments, and they certainly don't foster any creativity. </p>
		
			</div>
			
				<div class="span6">
				<h4><i class="icon-heart"></i>I care.</h4>
					<p>About <em>everything</em>. I care about doing good work. I care about my clients. I care about the people who use the things I make. When people care, they invest their mental energies into making something great. I like being able to afford Louboutins and Cristal, but ultimately, it's not what motivates me. I want to make beautiful, usable things that people love. I think Basecamp is this.</p>
				
				<h4><i class="icon-glass"></i>I believe in transparency.</h4>
					<p>This is why you can find me on my business' blog, talking about nude modelling or landing in a Thai jail. I believe that businesses should be responsible to their customers, and I've applied this to my own business. Basecamp's policy of transparency makes me happy. And your world-class customer support is something I'd like to get behind.</p>
		
				<h4><i class="icon-cog"></i>Oh, and I'm a pretty good designer, too.</h4>
					<p>There's no way my little business would be celebrating its eighth birthday this year if I weren't. I'm great with HTML and CSS, and I've got a pretty solid familiarity with Rails, which I used to drive my website a few years ago. I've got a bit of Javascript knowledge but could use learning more. Luckily, I've got a soft spot/hard-on for learning, and I'm always trying to learn new things and better my process. </p>
					<p>This is the primary reason why I want to work at Basecamp. I love running my business, but, after a great deal of wine-fuelled soul-searching, I've realized that I can choose to either grow as a businessperson, or as designer, and I choose designer. I refuse to give up my business for a mediocre job, or one that won't fullfil or challenge me. I believe Basecamp is this company.</p>
					<p>Let's make great things together.</p>
